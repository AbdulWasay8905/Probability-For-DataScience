# Probability for Data Science  

This repository covers the fundamental probability and statistics concepts required in data science. It includes explanations, formulas, and practical implementations in Python.  

## Topics Covered  
- **Mean, Median, Mode** – Understanding measures of central tendency  
- **Variance & Standard Deviation** – Measuring spread of data  
- **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** – Importance in probability distributions  
- **Hypothesis Testing** – Statistical decision-making (Z-Test, T-Test, Chi-Square Test, etc.)  

## Why This Repository?  
Probability and statistics form the backbone of data science. These concepts help in understanding datasets, building models, and making informed decisions based on data.
